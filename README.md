In this project I worked with datasets provided by MuscleHub Gym. 
An A/B test has been conducted in order to analyze an association between the 
fitness test taken by customer and subsequent completion of application / membership purchase. 

Chi-Square test has been chosen to calculate p-values and to decide about statistically significant
difference between variables written as contigency table. 
Categorical variable is defined: - Group A (people with fitness taken) 
				 - Group B (people that skipped fitness test)
